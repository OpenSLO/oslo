## Things to know

The goal of this project is to provide a simple tool for interacting with the
[OpenSLO specification](https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO).
Schema definitions and validation rules are all coming from
[OpenSLO Go SDK](https://github.com/OpenSLO/go-sdk) and `oslo` is only
providing a thin, CLI wrapper over the SDK.
